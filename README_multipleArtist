# README_multipleArtists (Run Multiple Artists)

## When to Use This

Use this when you want reports for **many artists at once**.

---

## Step 1: Add Artists to the List

Open the file:

```
artists.txt
```

Add **one artist per line**:

```
Brian Dunne
Fantastic Cat
David Wilcox
```

Save the file.

---

## Step 2: Run the Batch Report

Basic command:

```
node scripts/runBatchIngestAndExport.js
```

Recommended (lets you confirm each artist):

```
node scripts/runBatchIngestAndExport.js --interactive
```

---

## What Happens Next

* Each artist gets their own CSV
* A combined CSV is also created
* This process can take **10–30 minutes** depending on the number of artists

---

## Output Files

You will see:

```
outputExports/
Artist 1 - Weekly Artist Tracking.csv
Artist 2 - Weekly Artist Tracking.csv
Weekly Artist Tracking - All Artists.csv
```

---

## If the Process Stops

You can safely re-run the command. Already-saved data will not be lost.

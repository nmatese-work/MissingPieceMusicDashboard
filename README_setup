# README_setup (First-Time Setup Guide)

## Who This Is For

This guide is for **first-time setup**. You only need to do this **once per computer**.

If you just want to run reports for artists, you can skip this and use:

* `README_singleArtist`
* `README_multipleArtists`

---

## What You Will End Up With

By the end of this setup, you will be able to:

* Run one command
* Automatically get a finished **CSV report** for an artist

No coding knowledge is required.

---

## Step 1: Install Required Software

### 1. Install Node.js

You have **two options**. Use **Option A** if you are comfortable copy‑pasting commands. Use **Option B** if you prefer downloading an installer.

---

#### Option A: Install Node.js from the Terminal (Recommended)

**macOS**

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install node
```

**Windows (PowerShell – Run as Administrator)**

```powershell
winget install CoreyButler.NVMforWindows
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

**Linux (Ubuntu / Debian)**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Verify installation:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

If both show numbers, Node.js is installed.

---

#### Option B: Install Node.js Using a Website

1. Go to [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the **LTS version**
3. Install using default options

Verify:

```bash
node --version
```

---

### 2. Install PostgreSQL

* Go to: [https://www.postgresql.org/download/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
* Install using default options
* Remember the **password** you choose during install

After installing, open Terminal and run:

```
psql --version
```

---

### 3. Install Git

* Go to: [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)
* Install using default options

---

## Step 2: Download the Project

1. Open Terminal
2. Copy and paste:

```
git clone <REPO_URL>
cd MissingPieceMusicDashboard
```

(Replace `<REPO_URL>` with the GitHub link provided to you.)

---

## Step 3: Install Project Files

Run:

```
npm install
```

This may take a few minutes. You only need to do this once.

---

## Step 4: Create the Environment File

1. In the project folder, create a file called `.env`
2. Paste this inside (we will fill it in next):

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/music_dashboard
CHARTMETRIC_REFRESH_TOKEN=PASTE_REFRESH_TOKEN_HERE
CHARTMETRIC_ACCESS_TOKEN=PASTE_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
OUTPUT_DIR=outputExports
```

---

## Step 5: Set Up the Database

Run these commands **one at a time**:

```
createdb music_dashboard
node scripts/testDb.js
```

If you see a success message, the database is ready.

---

## Step 6: Set Up Chartmetric Access

1. Log into Chartmetric
2. Copy your **Refresh Token**
3. Paste it into the `.env` file

Then run:

```
node scripts/exchange_chartmetric_token.js
```

Copy the `access_token` shown in the Terminal and paste it into `.env`.

Test it:

```
node scripts/testChartmetricAuth.js
```

---

## Setup Complete ✅

You never need to do this again unless:

* You switch computers
* Your Chartmetric token expires
